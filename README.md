## James Harper tech test

- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run server` will run the API at `http://localhost:8000`
- Available API endpoints are `/devices`, `/devices/:id`, `/devices/:id/connections`
- `npm run start` will run the React app at `http://localhost:3000`

### Remaining work

If I had a bit more time, I would have done the following:
- Add some basic filtering to the API endpoints (eg `from_date` & `to_date`)
- Add a way to filter by date to the GUI
- Put a bit more effort into the styling. Would possibly just use a frontend framework.
- Add POST endpoints for creating additional data
- Add some tests
